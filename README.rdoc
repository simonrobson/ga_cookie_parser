= Google Analytics Cookie Parser

Simple ruby library for parsing the __umtz and __umta cookies which Google Analytics uses to track referrers and visitors.

You may wish to use this library to integrate data from Google Analytics into your internal CRM or sales tracking application.

== Installation

The library is available as a gem.

    gem install ga_cookie_parser

== Usage

Create an instance, or use the convenience method GaCookieParser.parse, providing a hash with keys :umtz and/or :umtz as argument.

    utmz = cookies["__utmz"] # in a rails controller context
    utma = cookies["__utma"]
    @data = GaCookieParser::GaCookieParser.new(:utmz => utmz, :utma => utma)

Then, @data provides #utmz_hash and #utma_hash methods which return hashes as follows:

    # @data.utmz_hash
    # note that not all of these will be present, and some are mutually exclusive
    {
      :domain_hash => '12979384',
      :timestamp   => '1294887021',  # unix timestamp
      :session_counter => '1',
      :campaign_number => '1',
      :utmcsr => 'google',       # source
      :utmccn => '(organic)',      # campaign name
      :utmcmd => 'organic',      # medium
      :utmctr => 'search term',    # term(s)
      :utmcct => '/ref.php,      # content (referring page in case of referrals)
      :utmgclid => 'CI7wh8C6tKYCFU2DpAod7z97IQ'  # gclid, linking referral back to adwords
    }
  
    # @data.utma_hash
    {
      :domain_hash => '12979384',
      :visitor_id =>  '1392679796',    # a random number
      :initial_visit_at =>  '1289844797',  # unix timestamp
      :previous_visit_at => '1294798990',  # unix timestamp
      :current_visit_at => '1294866800',  # unix timestamp
      :session_counter => '1' 
    }
